# Meetup World
Global Meetup Enhanced Search

# Why
Global meetups on www.meetup.com are not easy to find, and when they are listed in search, they show the time in the event time zone, not in your local time zone(s). This is a big problem if you are trying to find an upcoming meetup. 

# How
Create a enhanced meetup global search that sort and display the result based on time zones(s) of choice

# Where
https://www.meetup.world this domain is owned by us, and will be transferred for free to any individual or organization that want to host it.
